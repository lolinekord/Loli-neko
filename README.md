# *Hi. I'm Lolineko.*
I am active in Discord.<br>
I enjoy coding as a hobby, using languages such as Python and simple JavaScript.<br>
The languages I would like to learn in the future are PHP and Java.<br>
I'm not very skilled and I'm an idiot, so I use Replit a lot.<br>
I'm also interested in malware and other dark stuff, but I'm too scared to get into it because I don't have the skills lol.
